          <h2 class="section__title">Woman spends too much time on Codepens despite advice; no plans to stop</h2>
          <div class="section__text-wrapper">
            <p>Sometimes, Internet users land themselves in an uncommon situation where an app or website can be used
              for
              both work
              and personal situations. Well, a young front-end designer was spending up to 13 hours on the site, Codepen
              for work
              and her hobby, which unfortunately, is also coding. </p>
            <p>The designer, whose work includes a <em>To-Do Terrarium</em>, clarified, "Well, I didn't <em> have
              </em>to
              use it for
              work but it was already part of my workflow. It just made sense as it was more efficient." The biggest
              issue, she
              said, is that she would hop on Codepen for work, but would get distracted by pens made by others in the
              community for
              unexpectedly long periods of time, which then causes her to spend even more time on the site.</p>
            <p> "I mean, that's terrible right?" she asked. Codepen, which brands itself as the best place to build,
              test,
              and
              discover front-end code, has declined to comment at this time.</p>

              I
              guess this is what happens when
              someone isn't happy with any of the floor plans found on Pinterest; she'll start making her own for the
              eventual home
              that she will never own. Nevertheless, there's a home office with a large window to look out of pensively
              during rainy
              days and a ton of "white space" for the cats to run around.</p>

        <p class="section__text">Get your fill of more CSS Grid items in this collection. There are a total of 32 pens
          to date... well, 33, if you count
          this one too. What can you expect in this collection? The hidden gems, in my totally unbiased opinion, are
          the
          recreation of the Pac-Man layout and coupons inspired by junk mail. A lot of joke items of things that
          shouldn't be done
          in CSS Grid, such as a shelf? Bathroom tiles wtf? and makeup palettes . If you are a cultured person, you
          will
          have a
          chance to enjoy a couple of pens inspired by Harry Potter and Pokemon. On the rare occasion that you are
          looking at this
          profile for something you can use in production, you really shouldn't. But, there are some real-world
          applications, such
          as the recipe layout, the product catalog, and color palettes for a style guide.
